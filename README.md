# ServerDashboard
A dashboard I'm developing for my personal server

This DashBoard will be written primarily in Python
utilizaing the Flask Library to host the website,
with some bash and python scripts to display
information on to it

The website is hosted on my server with the intent
to be used by myself and family to aid in day to 
day tasks and smart home integration
